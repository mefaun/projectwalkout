I feel a lot of things are still rather vague at this moment. We will have to discuss this document over and set a more definite, clearer goal.


= TESTING =
==========

06/03/2014 - Integration Test needed for alpha, Contract Testing comes after, then Beta stage can be implemented

= OVERVIEW =
============

Hip-Hop Life is a web browser-based multi-player dancer simulation game (RPG). This design document states the goals and purposes of codename WALKOUT (version 1.0). Every developer should always work from the latest version of the design document.

= THE USER EXPERIENCE =
=======================

The fundamental architecture of the game engine is based on gaming ideas from classic computer role-playing games (cRPG) we may have played on videogame consoles or computer.

I thoroughly enjoyed playing cRPGs - from character creation till the final encounters - the broad range of spells, skills and specialties, and more. I am simply fascinated by the extent of details and rich role-playing atmosphere.

As a player of Hip-Hop Life, he or she will experience a turn-based multiplayer game with extracts of the essentials from various cRPGs, combined with interesting ideas from other types of RPGs such as multiple user dungeons (MUDs), paper & pen RPGs (pnpRPGs).

Hip-Hop Life is written in PHP, a powerful dynamic server-side scripting language. OOP is the structure. A multiplayer environment is created by manipulation of the MySQL database, with PDO in thought. Every time a client accesses a page, PHP will access the database and dynamically generate the necessary HTML content.

Real-time interactions are limited by a tick-based system, in a form of stamina. A quick response along with some strategy is required. Although timing can be affected by the variable connection speeds, a forced delay is imposed on the player as a consequence of each action to balance the difference.

Research points can be used three times a day, training your dancer at certain areas can give bonuses to certain attributes.

The basic interface to the role-playing environment consists of a character's view to the surroundings, known as "local view". A local view includes structures (such as shops, houses, stages, etc.), objects (such as items) and players within the region. Interactions between players (visualisation, talk, trade or battle) are also usually limited to a particular region of the main menu. A picture and description may be attached to special locations. Adjacent locations are joined together in a hexagonal manner to form a world. These locations are represented by square tiles (much like classic cRPGs).

Role-playing is encouraged in the game by relying on individual players' co-operation and respect. This can also be enforced by game rules and penalties.

A player starts off as a new jack with no moves. The player will have to battle its way through the tutorial, the player has to gain enough experience to start competing with other dancers. The path taken until the end of the tutorial determines what style he or she will be.

From that point onwards, the player takes hold of their hip-hop career. He or she can be a solo player, or team up with other players to form a crew, or get involved with politics and be part of a war competing for a pieces of property. (as expansion)

Each player can equip with his or her own skills and develop their own personal style. Some may offer to build a studio or a shop. Some may choose to heal the injured. Some with expertise may share their knowledge with you.

Location such as shops can be visited to obtain certain items that will enhance the dancer. They can buy DVDs to watch and learn special styles.

Competing with other players (battling) are encouraged to do so and will join in the world rankings.

The battle system consists of moves selected during each round. These moves can be selected before a battle and initiated during a battle.

= THE PLATFORM =
===============

Server: Web server with PHP and MySQL
Client: Web browser with JavaScript / CSS / PNG support


= THE USERS =
=============

General audience, users with interest in the RPG genre. Users with interest of Hip-Hop.


= TIME MANAGEMENT =
===================

A basic average player is expected to spend approximately half an hour a day (limited by turns, such as the use of stamnia points, or research points) as "maintenance" to his or her character. Experience users take part in more roles may spend an excess of one to two hours per day.

WALKOUT is a persistent world. However to maintain a balance between old and new players, an "aging" factor will be imposed on players. The aging process includes faster skills atrophy, greater chance of creative boxk, and eventually involving quittage.

As there is always a possibility to expand the worlds and implementing new things, I estimate the lifespan of the final product can last for a few years.



= CONCEPTS =
============

Design concepts and ideas are to be listed here.

SUBJECT: storyline
STATUS: draft
DESCRIPTION:
The world is heavily cultured in hip-hop and involves the large hip-hop competitions. Dancers gather and compete with each other in this world with the same goal - to be the best.

STATUS: Completed

Body Type:

Players select from height and weight.

A skinny body are able to do more clean moves but lacks in strength to do pops.

--

SUBJECT: Dancer Style
STATUS: important
DESCRIPTION:
The style is not entirely by choice but by the path the character follows. The style is determined by the players's path in the tutorial. Types of dancers known to the WALKOUT world are:

(Form: A more descriptive input is required from you especially when I am not good at the language. The description should first concentrate on descriptive / qualitative approach first, then game attribute / quantitative. Which is obviously not what I am doing here.)

< Allstyles >
Introduction: Allstyles are of a well-balanced style to which all others compare to, with no particular strengths or weaknesses.
Appearance: Passionate, confident features.
Feature: Well balanced attributes.

< Storyteller>
Introduction: You recover stamnia much quicker which lets you freely tell your story more in rounds. Your hits however appear less common.

SUBJECT: PVP Balanced
STATUS: draft
DESCRIPTION:
Dancers will comet against each other at stages/competitions. Dancers are usually balanced depending on what stage, so not one player is overpowering an another.
